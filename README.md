# Two Sum - LeetCode Solution  

## Problem Description  
The **Two Sum** problem is a classic algorithmic challenge where we are given an array of integers `nums` and an integer `target`. The goal is to find two numbers in the array that add up to `target` and return their indices.  

- Each input has **exactly one solution**.  
- The **same element cannot be used twice**.  
- The answer can be returned in **any order**.  

### **Example**  
#### **Input:**  
```python
nums = [1, 3, 8, 12]
target = 9
